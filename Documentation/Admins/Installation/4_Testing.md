# Testing

## Testing the installation inside TYPO3

After your preparation, installation and configuration of in2publish, you should log in to the backend of your Local
TYPO3.
Open the backend module **Publish Tools** and select Tests from the drop down.

You should see a couple of test result containers for the configuration tests of in2publish. Please follow the
instructions.

Hint:

> Please note that the container with **SSH2 Functions** could be red, because you do not have a recent copy of the ssh2
> library for PHP.
> That means that in2publish cannot set permissions for new files and folders on Foreign. If you are using the Foreign's
> webprocess user, you do not have to fear any problems. If you are using a different user, you must keep track of
> the permissions by yourself, using ACLs or something like that.

Hint:

> Some tests will be executed in the background from time to time.
> If a problem is detected, a notice will be shown in the other modules, indicating that the test have to be run.
