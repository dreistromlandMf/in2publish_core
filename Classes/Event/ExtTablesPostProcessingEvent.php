/**
 * This class replaces the "ExtTablesPostProcessingHook" which was registered using
 * $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['GLOBAL']['extTablesInclusion-PostProcessing'] The actual hook was removed
 * and the suggested replacement is listening to the TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\Event\BootCompletedEvent. The problem with
 * that event is though, that IT IS DISPATCHED BEFORE ext_tables.php files are included, which ultimately defeats the
 * purpose. So we here we go again and do it ourselves.
 *
 * Required until the patch got merged and released.
 *
 * Issue: https://forge.typo3.org/issues/95962
 * Patch: https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/72160
